# O-Zone: An Air Quality Monitoring System
O-zone is an IoT-based project designed to monitor the Air Quality Index (AQI) levels of the surrounding areas and provide alerts for smoke detection. The project is built using Arduino UNO, NodeMCU, a bidirectional bus, and three sensors â€“ DHT11, MQ2, and MQ135. It aims to enhance environmental awareness and promote healthier living by providing real-time air quality data. :rotating_light:.

## Features

* Measures AQI levels to assess the air quality in the surrounding areas.
* Provides alerts when smoke is detected, alerting users to potential fire hazards.
* Tracks temperature and humidity to assess overall environmental conditions.
* Utilizes NodeMCU and a bidirectional bus for efficient data communication.
* Offers real-time data updates on Blynk App for informed decision-making.

## Hardware Components

1. Arduino UNO: The main microcontroller for controlling the system.
2. NodeMCU: Enables WiFi connectivity and data transmission.
3. DHT11 Sensor: Measures temperature and humidity levels.
4. MQ2 Sensor: Detects LPG, Smoke, Alcohol, Propane, Hydrogen, Methane and Carbon Monoxide concentrations ranging from 200 to 10000 ppm.
5. MQ135 Sensor: Detects gases like Ammonia (NH3), sulfur (S), Benzene (C6H6), CO2, and other harmful gases and smoke.
6. Bidirectional Bus: Facilitates communication between sensors and Arduino UNO to NodeMCU.
7. Buzzer: Produces sound alerts for smoke detection.
8. LED: Provides visual indication for smoke detection.
9. Breadboard: Used for prototyping and connecting electronic components.
10. Jumper Wires: Connects components and sensors to Arduino UNO and power supply.

## Usage
* Power on the system and ensure that all the sensors and components are properly connected.
* The system will start monitoring the air quality and display real-time data on the connected device (e.g., smartphone or computer).
* If smoke is detected, the system will activate the buzzer and LED to notify users about potential fire hazards.
* Monitor the AQI levels and take necessary precautions based on the air quality data.
